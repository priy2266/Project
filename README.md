# Project
Task 1: Basic Syntax
. Create a C++ program to print "Hello,World!" on the console.
  use std::cout for output and std::endl to add a new line.

Task 2: Simple Calculator
. Build a basic calculator in C that can add,subtract,multiply 
  and divide two numbers. Use switch-case for operations. Ensure
  the program handles division by zero gracefully.

Task 3: Loops % Conditions
. Write a C++ program that prints all even numbers from 1 to
  100. Use for loop and the modulo operator. Ensure the 
  program skips odd numbers.

Task 4: Arrays & Functions
. Create a C program to find the largest number in an array of
  integers. Use functions for code reusability. Prompt the 
  user to enter the array size and values dynamically.
